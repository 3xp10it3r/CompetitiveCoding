# Reverse

Given an array, `A`, of `n` integers, print each element in reverse order as a single line of space-separated integers.


## Input format

The first line contains an integer, `n` (the number of integers in `A`). 
The second line contains `n` space separated integers describing `A`.

## Output Format

Print all `n` integers in `A` in reverse order.


## Analysis

The basic logic is as follows :
- Write each element of input into an array.
- Iterate through the array in reverse, printing each element as you go.
